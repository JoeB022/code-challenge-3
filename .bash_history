### SimpleWebsite Project

This project is a basic setup for a simple static website. The project includes a main HTML file, CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity, and a directory for images. The goal of this project is to practice organizing a website's files and directory structure, as well as to get hands-on experience with basic web development.
#### Project Overview
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the website.
- **css/styles.css**: The stylesheet that contains the CSS code for styling the website.
- **js/script.js**: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity to the website.
- **img/**: A directory initially meant to store images for the website.
#### Directory Structure
```
